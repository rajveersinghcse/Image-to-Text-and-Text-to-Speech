# Image_to_Text_and_Text_to_Speech

<h3>Hey,👨🏻‍💻</h3>
<p>This program can convert the image into text and give that image into text output. And convert that output into Speech form.</p>

# Libraries that I used in this program:

### I used mainly Pytesseract library to create this program.

#### 👉 If you want to install that librarie you have to install it by using this command.

```bash
pip install pytesseract
```


### Alongside this library, you need to install the Tesseract-OCR. Tesseract-OCR is nothing but an optical character reading engine.
